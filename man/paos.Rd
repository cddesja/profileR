\title{Profile Analysis for One Sample with Hotelling's T-Square}
\usage{
paos(data, scale = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data matrix or data frame; rows represent individuals, columns represent variables.}

\item{scale}{If TRUE (default), variables are standardized by dividing their standard deviations.}
}
\value{
A summary table is returned, listing the following two hypothesis:
\itemize{
 \item Hypothesis 1 - Ratios of the means of the variables over the hypothesized mean are equal to 1.
\item Hypothesis 2 - All of the ratios are equal to each other.
}
}
\description{
The \code{paos} function implements profile analysis for one sample using Hotelling's T-square.
}
\details{
The \code{paos} function runs profile analysis for one sample based on the Hotelling's T-square test and tests the two htypothesis. First, the null hypothesis that all the rations of the variables in the data equal to 1. After rejecting the first hypothesis, a secondary null hypothesis that all of the ratios of the variables in the data equal to one another (not necessarily equal to 1) is tested.
