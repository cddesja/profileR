Title: Profile Analysis of Multivariate Data in R
Type: Package
Description: A suite of multivariate methods and data visualization 
      tools to implement profile analysis and cross-validation techniques described in 
      Davison & Davenport (2002) <DOI: 10.1037/1082-989X.7.4.468>, Bulut (2013), and other published and unpublished resources.
      The package includes routines to perform criterion-related profile analysis, profile analysis 
      via multidimensional scaling, moderated profile analysis, generalizability theory, profile analysis by group, and a 
      within-person factor model to derive score profiles.
